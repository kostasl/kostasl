This is still in the making, but in any case here I intend to list all publication contributions and note how they intersect with the main focus [see About]{{ site.baseurl }}{% link about.markdown %}  : 

1. Using an insect mushroom body circuit to encode route memory in complex natural environments
2. Continuous lateral oscillations as a core mechanism for taxis in Drosophila larvae
3. The rise and fall of memory in a model of synaptic integration
4. Taming fluctuations in a stochastic model of spike-timing-dependent plasticity
5. A model of larval biomechanics reveals exploitable passive properties for efficient locomotion
6. Modelling the mechanics of exploration in larval Drosophila
7. Monitoring brain activity and behaviour in freely moving Drosophila larvae using bioluminescence
8. Mechanics of exploration in Drosophila melanogaster
9. Learning steers the ontogeny of an efficient hunting sequence in zebrafish larvae
10. A Model of Larval Biomechanics Reveals Exploitable Passive Properties for Efficient Locomotion
