This is an attempt to produce an online place for outreach, where I get to introduce my self and share:  ideas, thoughts and projects from neuroscience to hacker projects.  


## Research Focus

My research attempts to understand living systems by studying behaviour and its mechanisms.   
My aim is produce minimal models that allow us to understand how embodied nervous systems achieve cognition and produce goal directed behaviour.


Nervertheless I am fascinated by diverse areas such as immune systems, ecology and neural development and circuit assembly,  although the opportunity and skills to work on such things has yet to arrive.      


## Projects

I am easily taken in by engineering projects and do-it-yourself gadgets. My undergraduate studies where in electrical-electronic engineering and I have not lost the bug for tech, even though I fell in love with biology.
I take opportunities to build my own experimental apparatus when needed (link to  projects [soon]).
I feel lucky to live at time and place where open-source hardware and micro-controllers are abundantly available and very affordable. If only I was a teeneger again!


## Software
I am a proponent of open-source and in love with its accessibility and diversity. 
If you don't use them already I suggest finding the courage and move out of comfort zone, discover Linux, by installing Ubuntu as your Operating system.
Write beautiful manuscripts and dissertations with [Latex][https://www.latex-project.org/]

My latest discovery was [jekyll][jekyll-organization] /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll),  while I was looking for a good way to make this simple website.
 
This website was created with Jekyll, and it uses the prologue theme. Find out more at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
