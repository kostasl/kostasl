 I was born and raised in Piraeus, Greece and studied electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Liverpool.
 I then followed up with a MSc. in Complexity Science at the University of Southampton. 
 It is during that time when I got hooked on neuroscience after meeting the three eyed tadpole 
 during a lecture on computational neuroscience, and hence the little three-eyed  avatar of this website. 
 
Following those studies, I returned to Greece for my compulsory national service.
This lasted a full year. The first terms were spent in the artillery division posted to the island of Chios, where I aso trained as a corporal.
The final few months of my service I was posted at the general army directive's informatics department,
where I was lucky enough to serve by coding army software, in peace.
 
After my release, I worked as an electronics engineer in industry for a year and 
then returned to Southampton to start a PhD in computational neuroscience.
My PhD thesis focused was purely theoretical and focused on a prominent problem 
in artificial neural memory systems memory systems: how to maintain old memories in the face of interference
by the continuous encoding of new memories.

This notorious problem is also known in the neural networks literature 
as the plasticity vs stability dilemma_, and different plasticity rules operating at the level of the synapse can 
have profound implications on a memory system's capacity to recall stored memories.
I have now come to realization that such memory systems, and the whole idea of encoding memories as trace or engrams is an ill-posed relic of a theory and incoherent (see Bennet&Hacker 2013,2003),
and does not relate to human memory. A new conceptual framework is needed on which to base studies of animal memory. 

My research is now focused on understanding the mechanics of behaviour in simpler, model organism.
I believe such understanding holds many surprises and can provide a solid foundation for the understanding of evermore complex organisms.
I am on the lookout to find that nature has come up with some very elegant solutions for behaviour in the wild. 
Such solutions may prove to be principled solutions shared across multiple species faced with the same problems.
An example for this from my side would be the continuous oscillator circuit 
that is perturbed by sensory stimuli allowing animals to navigate large odour/sensory gradients :
[Drosophila chemotaxis behaviour model](https://elifesciences.org/articles/15504) 
and the implications for how the neural systems of behaviour guide behaviour.
