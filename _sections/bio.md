I was born in Piraeus Greece, just near the time you could get a Commodore 64 as a home computer.
I showed an early interest in computers and coding, and through a stuck of luck I managed to land a webdeveloper job at the internet service provider (ISP) I was using at the time in the late '90 (the infamous _Compulink_ among geeks).  
After working there for 3 years I had gathered mirriads of lines of code under my belt, and decided to move on. I went on to study electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Liverpool and then followed up with a MSc. in Complexity Science at the University of Southampton. It is during that time where I got hooked on neuroscience after meeting the _three eyed tadpole_ during a lecture on computational neuroscience. 
Following those studies, I returned to Greece for my compulsory national service.
 This lasted a full year. The first terms were spent in the artillery division posted to the island of Chios, where I aso trained as a corporal.
 The last few months I was posted in the general army directive's informatics department where I could offer by coding software for the army, in peace.
 
After my release, I worked as an electronics engineer in industry for a year and then returned to Southampton to start a PhD in computational neuroscience.
