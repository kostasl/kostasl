 I was born and raised in Piraeus, Greece and studied electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Liverpool.
 I then followed up with a MSc. in Complexity Science at the University of Southampton. 
 It is during that time when I got hooked on neuroscience after meeting the three eyed tadpole 
 during a lecture on computational neuroscience, and hence the little three-eyed  avatar of this website. 
 
Following those studies, I returned to Greece for my compulsory national service.
This lasted a full year. The first terms were spent in the artillery division posted to the island of Chios, where I aso trained as a corporal.
The final few months of my service I was posted at the general army directive's informatics department,
where I was lucky enough to serve by coding army software, in peace.
 
After my release, I worked as an electronics engineer in industry for a year and 
then returned to Southampton to do a PhD in computational neuroscience.
I then went on to do a postdoc at University of Edinburgh in the lab of Barbara Webb, where I got the chance to work on the mechanics
and models of behaviour of insects.
After three lovely years in Edinburgh, I got a postdoc position in at King's College London, in the lab of Martin Meyer.
Since 2018 I have been a research associate at King's College London doing neuroscience research towards understanding the 
neural and behavioural principles of adaptive behaviour using the amazing zebrafish larvae as a model organism.
