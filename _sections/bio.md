I was born in Piraeus Greece, just near the time you could get a Commodore 64 as a home computer.
I showed an early interest in computers and coding and equipped with determination, luck and enthusiasm, once I finished school I managed to land the most exciting job I could think of at the time: being a webdeveloper at the internet service provider (ISP)  I was a client to since the mid '90 (the infamous _Compulink_ among greek geeks).  
After working there for 3 years I had gathered mirriads of lines of code under my belt, and decided to move on.
 I went on to study electrical and electronic engineering at the University of Liverpool and then followed up with a MSc. in Complexity Science at the University of Southampton. It is during that time where I got hooked on neuroscience after meeting the _three eyed tadpole_ during a lecture on computational neuroscience, and hence the little three-eyed  avatar of this website. 
Following those studies, I returned to Greece for my compulsory national service.
 This lasted a full year. The first terms were spent in the artillery division posted to the island of Chios, where I aso trained as a corporal.
 The finalfew months of my service found me posted at the general army directive's informatics department, where I was lucky enough to serve by coding army software, in peace.
 
After my release, I worked as an electronics engineer in industry for a year and then returned to Southampton to start a PhD in computational neuroscience.
My PhD thesis focused was purely theoretical and focused on a prominent problem of episodic-like memory systems: how to maintain old memories in the face of interference by the continuous encoding of new memories. This notorious problem is also known in the neural networks literature as the _plasticity vs stability dilemma_, and different plasticity rules operating at the level of the synapse can have profound implications on a memory system's capacity to recall stored memories.
