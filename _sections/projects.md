I am easily taken in by engineering projects and do-it-yourself, and maker projects.
 My undergraduate studies where in electrical-electronic engineering and I have not lost the bug for tech, even though I fell in love with biology.
I take opportunities to build my own experimental apparatus when needed (link to  projects [soon]).
I feel lucky to live at time and place where open-source hardware and micro-controllers are abundantly available and very affordable. If only I was a teeneger again!

I have designed customized experimental apparatus to meet my specific experimental requirements.
When it comes to designing apparatus I operate as a frugal engineer.
I try to find a cost-effective way of obtaining good enough data such that the cost-barrier is lowered and similar experimental setups can be built and experiments replicated in as many labs across the world as possible.
It is for the  same reason I am a proponent of open source hardware and software projects.
I am always open to sharing designs and solutions. 
So please get in touch, as I have to recognize that although willing to share I find the work involved with documenting and 
publicly sharing designs to be overwhelming.
Especially when the pressure is to carry on with research and make the next experiment happen. I am forever in debt to those who have taken time to share and document their work. 

I will try to collect some of my works and share here:

1. [3D printed Optical Slit design for DYI Light-sheet microscope](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e2989669a249a84f3d34795a/w/2316bf5b7371057718f6a064/e/68a2ba408584b1c1c4241540)
   I made a little affordable light-sheet microscope at home, using plastic lenses and cheap laser. I have yet to document the whole project, but this optical slit may come in handy.
   
1. [Half-light ring holder for 35mm petridish arena for microscope mounted experiments](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d0fc86446e7332e5cc0da078/w/572e1355dbb929749a8153f5/e/7f476d67bc2b59f7ed11b25e)
    This half arena allows for showing visual stimuli on side, while illuminating with IR on the other. The behaviooural recording camera is mounted from below. 
1. [IR LED ring holder for 35mm petridish arena (Autodesk Inventor file)](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fbfdd81b4eb376409ab08de8/w/678074c3ee30109b566cdfc9/e/950330e3d3ebb4c5d5e5058b)
   For zebrafish behavioural experiments
1. [LED bar, for building custom IR illumination stages](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/09089b6d59ab93e061e7ffa5/w/c411326a0b6039e9f9462551/e/658c6f6dccfd52afe84f879f)
   Was used to build a Drosophila larva arena behavioural recording arena by combining 4 of these to build a rectangle and and mounting a square perspex in the center.

### Software
I am a proponent of open-source and in love with its accessibility and diversity. 
If you don't use them already I suggest finding the courage and move out of comfort zone, discover Linux, by installing [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as your operating system.
Write beautiful manuscripts and dissertations with [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/)
My latest discovery was 
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll),  while I was looking for a good way to make this simple website.
This website was created with Jekyll, and it uses the prologue theme. Find out more at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
You can find the source code for Jekyll on GitHub

software:

1. [A behavioural tail tracker for tethered zebrafish larvae](https://github.com/kostasl/TailTracker)
   Use this for tracking the tail behaviour while calcium imaging zebrafish larva brains.  
1. [A fast ellipse detect algorithm](https://github.com/kostasl/ellipseDetect)
1. A behavioural tracker for freely swimming larvae (tba) 
1. A ROI triggered FLIR camera recorder (tba)
1. [An interval timer for martial arts gyms](https://github.com/kostasl/IntervalTimerbjj)

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
