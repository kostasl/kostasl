I am easily taken in by engineering projects and do-it-yourself, and maker projects.
 My undergraduate studies where in electrical-electronic engineering and I have not lost the bug for tech, even though I fell in love with biology.
I take opportunities to build my own experimental apparatus when needed (link to  projects [soon]).
I feel lucky to live at time and place where open-source hardware and micro-controllers are abundantly available and very affordable. If only I was a teeneger again!


### Software
I am a proponent of open-source and in love with its accessibility and diversity. 
If you don't use them already I suggest finding the courage and move out of comfort zone, discover Linux, by installing [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as your operating system.
Write beautiful manuscripts and dissertations with [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/)

My latest discovery was 
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll),  while I was looking for a good way to make this simple website.
 
This website was created with Jekyll, and it uses the prologue theme. Find out more at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
You can find the source code for Jekyll on GitHub

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
