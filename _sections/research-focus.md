My research aims to understand how brains operate by studying simple behaviours and trying to uncover its mechanisms.   
The aim is produce minimal models that allow us to understand how embodied nervous systems allow for cognition and produce goal directed behaviour.
This research is guided by taking into account the ecological rationality of the specific behaviours and the possible heurestic computations available to the animal in that context.    


Nervertheless I am fascinated by diverse areas such as immune systems, ecology and neural development and circuit assembly,  although the opportunity and skills to work on such things has yet to arrive.
