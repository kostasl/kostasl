My PhD thesis focused was purely theoretical and focused on a prominent problem 
in artificial neural memory systems memory systems: how to maintain old memories in the face of interference
by the continuous encoding of new memories.
This notorious problem is also known in the neural networks literature 
as the plasticity vs stability dilemma_, and different plasticity rules operating at the level of the synapse can 
have profound implications on a memory system's capacity to recall stored memories.
I have now come to realization that such memory systems, and the whole idea of encoding memories as trace or engrams is an ill-posed relic of a theory and incoherent (see [1,2]),
and does not relate to human memory. A new conceptual framework is needed on which to base studies of animal memory. 

My research is now focused on understanding the mechanics of behaviour in simpler, model organism.
I believe such understanding holds many surprises and can provide a solid foundation for the understanding of evermore complex organisms.
I am on the lookout to find that nature has come up with some very elegant solutions for behaviour in the wild. 
Such solutions may prove to be principled solutions shared across multiple species faced with the same problems.
An example for this from my side would be the continuous oscillator circuit 
that is perturbed by sensory stimuli allowing animals to navigate large odour/sensory gradients [3]
and the implications for how the neural systems of behaviour guide behaviour.

I am also keen on designing and building customized apparatus experimental apparatus to meet my specific experimental requirements.
When it comes to designing apparatus I operate as a frugal engineer.
I try to find a cost-effective way of obtaining good enough data such that the cost-barrier is lowered and similar experimental setups can be built and experiments replicated in as many labs across the world as possible.
It is for the  same reason I am a proponent of open source hardware and software projects.
I am always open to sharing designs and solutions. 
So please get in touch, as I have to recognize that although willing to share I find the work involved with documenting and 
publicly sharing designs to be overwhelming.
Especially when the pressure is to carry on with research and make the next experiment happen. I am forever in debt to those who have taken time to share and document their work. 

I will try to collect some of my works and share here:

1. [3D printed Optical Slit design for DYI Light-sheet microscope](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e2989669a249a84f3d34795a/w/2316bf5b7371057718f6a064/e/0ec593a92e364a7f575f407a)
   I made a little affordable light-sheet microscope at home, using plastic lenses and cheap laser. I have yet to document the whole project, but this optical slit may come in handy.
1. [Half-light ring holder for 35mm petridish arena for microscope mounted experiments](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d0fc86446e7332e5cc0da078/w/572e1355dbb929749a8153f5/e/7f476d67bc2b59f7ed11b25e)
    This half arena allows for showing visual stimuli on side, while illuminating with IR on the other. The behaviooural recording camera is mounted from below.

   Was used to build a Drosophila larva arena behavioural recording arena by combining 4 of these to build a rectangle and and mounting a square perspex in the center.
