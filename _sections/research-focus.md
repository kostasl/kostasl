I am a research associate at King's College London doing neuroscience research towards understanding the neural and behavioural principles of adaptive behaviour. 

My research aims to understand how brains operate by studying simple behaviours to uncover the mechanisms and principles of operation.
I favour studying animals with tiny brains, as there are indespensible lessons to be learned in how simpler systems work before attempting at more complex cases. 
The study of specific behaviours of these simpler systems should encompass the ecological rationality and the possible heurestic computations available to them in that context.
For this, I record detailed experimental data from small animals conducting simple goal-oriented behaviours and conduct analyses by employing machine vision, statistical inference, and machine learning techniques. 
This understanding is to be encapsulated by minimal models that characterize the core mechanisms of how embodied nervous systems allow for cognition and produce goal directed behaviour. 
Such approach provides a promising route to the development of a much needed [1] theoretical framework that will enable us to convert brain data into fundamental knowledge and organising principles of how organisms make sense of their world and generate behaviour.

I am also keen on designing and building customized apparatus experimental apparatus to meet my specific experimental requirements.
 To this I am proponent of open hardware and designing affordable experimental plaftforms.
  Here my mind operates as a frugal engineer. I try to find a cost-effective way of obtaining good enough data such that the cost barrier is lowered and similar experimental setups can be built and experiments replicated in as many labs across the world as possible.
It is for the  same reason I am a big proponent of open source hardware and software projects.
So I am alway open to sharing designs and solutions. So get in touch, as I have to recognize that although willing to share I find the work involved with documenting and publically sharing designs to be overwhelming, especially when the pressure is to carry on with research and make the next experiment happen. I am forever in debt to those who have taken time to share and document their work.
