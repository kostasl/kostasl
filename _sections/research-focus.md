My PhD thesis focused was purely theoretical and focused on a prominent problem 
in artificial neural memory systems (engrams): how to maintain old memories in 
the face of interference by the continuous encoding of new memories.
This apparent notorious problem is also known as the _plasticity vs stability dilemma_.  
A mathematical formulation of a memory system reveals that different plasticity rules, operating 
at the level of the single synapse, can have profound implications on a memory system's capacity to 
recall stored memories. _Or so it seems_. 
I have now come to realization that the conceptual framework of memory we used, the
associated ideas of memory engrams is most likely _misconceived_ and the puzzles it generates are illusions [1,4].
I would like to someday and lay bare these misconceptions with the hope of proposing a new conceptual framework 
that could guide memory systems research.

The current framework on the nature of memory and the plasticity-stability dilemma can be traced by back to Aristotle. 
But it misconceived. The apparent puzzle of stability vs plasticity is most likely an illusion arising from conceptual confusions.
The whole idea of encoding memories as trace or engrams is an ill-posed relic of a theory and incoherent (see [1,2]),
and does not relate to human memory. A new conceptual framework is needed on which to base studies of animal memory.

My research is now focused on understanding the mechanics of behaviour in simpler, model organism.
I believe such understanding holds many surprises and can provide a solid foundation for the understanding of evermore complex organisms.
I am on the lookout to find that nature has come up with some very elegant solutions for behaviour in the wild. 
Such solutions may prove to be principled solutions shared across multiple species faced with the same problems.
An example for this from my side would be the continuous oscillator circuit 
that is perturbed by sensory stimuli allowing animals to navigate large odour/sensory gradients [3]
and the implications for how the neural systems of behaviour guide behaviour.  
My most recent neuroscience work focuses on development, and how experience shapes foraging and hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish.
For this I employ behavioural imaging as well as 2-photon calcium imaging techniques and analysis.
