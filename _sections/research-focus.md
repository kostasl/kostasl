My research aims to understand how brains operate by studying simple behaviours and trying to uncover their principles of operation and mechanisms, while taking into account the ecological rationality of the specific behaviours and the possible heurestic computations available to the animal in that context.
This understanding is to be encapsulated by minimal models that characterize the core mechanisms of how embodied nervous systems allow for cognition and produce goal directed behaviour. 
This approach I believe provides a promissing route to a theoretical framework that willl allow for converting brain data into fundamental knowledge and organising principles of how sensory stimuli drive behaviour.


Nervertheless I am fascinated by diverse areas such as immune systems, ecology and neural development and circuit assembly,  although the opportunity and skills to work on such things has yet to arrive.
